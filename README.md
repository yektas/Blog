# Blog
A blog website that is build with Django, React and GraphQL

### Backend

The backend will be written with Django. I will not use django-rest-framework because I want to try GraphQL. That's why I will use graphene-django library.

### Frontend

For the frontend ReactJS will be used. I chose material ui for the ui framework. For the post editor, I will use react-quill library.
